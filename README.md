This Obsidian Plugin allows users to have a different file explorer experience.
Please watch the sample record to see the details.
You can find all release details under the [Release Updates](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative/blob/main/Releases.md)

### Features: 

 - The plugin lists all files including the `files under sub-folders`. You can turn off this option from plugin settings if you want to see only the files under certain folder.
 - Folders and files are in `separate views`.
 - You can see the `number of notes` under each folder within the `folders` view. You have an option if you want to see the number for notes or total files. You can also turn this function off completely.
 - The plugin remembers `last expanded folders` state to load for the following session.
 - The plugin allows you to `Pin` your favorite files to the top. They are saved for the following sessions.
 - You can use `ribbon icon` to activate the `File Tree Leaf` in case you close by mistake. You can turn off `ribbon icon` from the plugin settings.
 - You can define certain `file extensions` in plugin settings to exclude from listing in file explorer.
 - You can define certain `folder paths` in plugin settings to exclude from main folder list. All subfolders are going to be excluded, as well.
- You can `star`/`unstar` your files in case you have `Starred` plugin turned on.
- You can drop `external files` into file list to add the files into current active folder path.
- You can turn on `search` feature from plugin settings to filter files with their names.
- You can turn on/off `root folder` within the file tree.

 **Note**: The last state of `expanded folders` and `pinned files` are saved in `data.json`. Please ensure that you don't delete them manually from `plugin settings` since it will delete all your configuration.

## Old Version (Evernote Style)

Due to fact that there was a limitation to manipulate the default `file explorer` of Obsidian, I needed to move away from the Evernote style approach. 

**If you still want to use this version, you need to handle the installation manually from `v1.0.1`:**

[File Tree Alternative Plugin v.1.0.1](https://github.com/ozntel/file-tree-alternative/releases/tag/1.0.1)
